* Page to query Giphy API and display 10 images based on the search
* Can type a search term and press on button to search Giphy images.  Can open a hamburger menu to search, go to contact section,
or about section. The user can scroll down to see all images.  Once at the bottom, the user can click on Back to Top link to get back
to the top of page.
* Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript
Ideas for future improvement:
* Allow user to choose, from a number range, the number of images to display. For example: 10, 20, or 50 images
* Be able to click on an image and display it on a separate tab with larger size
* Include links to social media such as Instagram
